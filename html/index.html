        To import students go to the import Students window and click import students. A dialog window will appear, select the CSV file you
        want to import. Your CSV file must be in a very specific format for the database to import it correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
         Each student should get their own line in the CSV file. First the Student ID Number should be listed, then the Student's first name
        then the Student's Middle Name, the Student's Last Name, and finally the student's gender. If the student does not have a Middle Name
        it should be entered as "NMN."

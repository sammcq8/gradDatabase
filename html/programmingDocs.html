            <h3>python-docx</h3>
            <p>
              Python-docx is used by the reports.py file to generate docx reports.

              Sqlite3 is a built in software package, it is used to access the database where all of the student data is stored.

          The main file is the file that handles all of the tkinter windows, except for the edit students popup window.

        <h3> Classes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>GradDatabase</h4>
            <p>
              This class handles the windowing of the program. It creates the Tkinter window, and creates instances of each of the frames that can be pulled
              up in the program. This class has one function - ShowFrame. This function takes the frame that is passed through it and sets it to the top frame
              so that is the one that is currently displayed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Edit Students Window</h4>
            <p>
              This class inherits the Tk.Frame class, and it handles the display of the Edit Students window. It has all of the menu buttons in the menuFrame
              and in the workspace frame it has a button that initializes a searchbox window that allows the user to input SID, First Name or Last Name.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Menu Window</h4>
            <p>
              This class has all of the menu buttons, each one calls the ShowFrame function from the GradDatabase class, passing 
              through the frame that they refrence, to bring that frame to the top level.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Import Students Window</h4>
            <p>
              This class has a menuFrame that has all of the different windows on it, just like every other frame.
              There is one button in the workspace frame that opens a open file dialog, the user is prompted to select
              a csv file that has all of the students information in it, and then calls a function that will import all
              of the students.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Mass Edit Students</h4>
            <p>
              This class has a menuFrame with buttons linking to all of the windows. The workspaceFrame has a drop down list with all of the possible
              fields that can be mass-changed.The user selects the value that they want to change from the drop down and then they indicate
              what they want the value to be with the checkbox. Then the select file button opens a open file dialog that allows them to 
              select what csv file they want to read from. After they have done all of this they click the save button which calls a function
              that looks at all of these values and passes them through to the functions.py file.
            </p>

      <div id = "functionsFile">
        <h2>functions.py</h2>
        <p>
          The functions file has all of the functions called by the program. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id = "reportsFile">
        <h2>reports.py</h2>
        <p>
          The reports file contains all the code used to generate reports. 
          It imports pyton-docx to write to docx files, and imports sqlite to pull from the DB file. 
          The format of each function is basically the same, a file path is passed through which is the file it will be saved as.
          Then, if the filepath is not an empty string the function executes some sqlite code to return a list of all of the students
          who meet the specific criteria for the report. It then opens a docx file for the specific template that is run. Some of the 
          functions such as the walking order sort the data, but most simply write the data to the docx file and then closes and save the
          file to the path that was passed through. This file also imports os.path to use the path extender to get the full path to the reports.
          
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id = "reportTemplates">
        <h2>Report Templates</h2>
        <p>
          The Report Templates folder contains all of the templates that the reports file refrences to create the reports. Due to 
          the limitations of python-docx the year on these files cannot be changed programatically. Python-docx cannot create columns,
          but it can work with pre-existing columns. If you change the template files at all ensure that the columns are still at the bottom of the 
          file.

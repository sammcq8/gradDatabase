        <h3> Classes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>GradDatabase</h4>
            <p>
              This class handles the windowing of the program. It creates the Tkinter window, and creates instances of each of the frames that can be pulled
              up in the program. This class has one function - ShowFrame. This function takes the frame that is passed through it and sets it to the top frame
              so that is the one that is currently displayed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Edit Students Window</h4>
            <p>
              This class inherits the Tk.Frame class, and it handles the display of the Edit Students window. It has all of the menu buttons in the menuFrame
              and in the workspace frame it has a button that initializes a searchbox window that allows the user to input SID, First Name or Last Name.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Menu Window</h4>
            <p>
              This class has all of the menu buttons, each one calls the ShowFrame function from the GradDatabase class, passing 
              through the frame that they refrence, to bring that frame to the top level.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Import Students Window</h4>
            <p>
              This class has a menuFrame that has all of the different windows on it, just like every other frame.
              There is one button in the workspace frame that opens a open file dialog, the user is prompted to select
              a csv file that has all of the students information in it, and then calls a function that will import all
              of the students.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Mass Edit Students</h4>
            <p>
              This class has a menuFrame with buttons linking to all of the windows. The workspaceFrame has a drop down list with all of the possible
              fields that can be mass-changed.The user selects the value that they want to change from the drop down and then they indicate
              what they want the value to be with the checkbox. Then the select file button opens a open file dialog that allows them to 
              select what csv file they want to read from. After they have done all of this they click the save button which calls a function
              that looks at all of these values and passes them through to the functions.py file.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Run Reports</h4>
            <p>
              Like the rest of the frames there is a menuFrame with buttons that lead to every other frame. There are then buttons that will allow you to create
              reports. Each button correlates to a function in the functions file and a template in the Report Templates folder. Each button calls the function that
              correlates to it from the functions file, passing through the filepath the user selects with a saveFileDialog prompt that appears when the user selects
              the button. The SaveFileDialog class is imported from Tkinter.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id = "functionsFile">
        <h2>functions.py</h2>
        <p>
          The functions file has all of the functions called by the program. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>def searchStudents(SID, Fname, Lname):</h4>
            <p>
              This function recives a SID value, a First name, and Last name. Some of the values passed through may be empty strings, and
              the first thing the function does is convert the empty strings to None values. It then runs a query in the database searching 
              for students that match the values passed through.
            </p>
            <p>
              This function returns a tuple of all of the students that match the passed through criteria
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>def returnStudent(studentInfo):</h4>
            <p>
              This function recives a tuple of the SID, FName and LName of the student. Non of these values can be none or null, but this is not
              a problem because
            </p>
            <p>
              This function returns 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
      </div>
      <div id = "reportsFile">
        <h2>reports.py</h2>
        <p>
          The reports file contains all the code used to generate reports. 
          It imports pyton-docx to write to docx files, and imports sqlite to pull from the DB file. 
          The format of each function is basically the same, a file path is passed through which is the file it will be saved as.
          Then, if the filepath is not an empty string the function executes some sqlite code to return a list of all of the students
          who meet the specific criteria for the report. It then opens a docx file for the specific template that is run. Some of the 
          functions such as the walking order sort the data, but most simply write the data to the docx file and then closes and save the
          file to the path that was passed through. This file also imports os.path to use the path extender to get the full path to the reports.
          
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id = "reportTemplates">
        <h2>Report Templates</h2>
        <p>
          The Report Templates folder contains all of the templates that the reports file refrences to create the reports. Due to 
          the limitations of python-docx the year on these files cannot be changed programatically. Python-docx cannot create columns,
          but it can work with pre-existing columns. If you change the template files at all ensure that the columns are still at the bottom of the 
          file.

        <h3>Sam's Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Sam, the creator of this application. In this section I'm going to talk a little about me, what made me make the decisons I made 
          for this program, and what I would do if I could do it again. This database massively helped me grow as a developer, especially as a Python
          Developer. Looking back I made a lot of mistakes in deciding how to make this program becasue of lack of knowlege and preconcived 
          notions. With that though, I am still at the time of writing this, very self taught. I'm a senior in high school, definetly not a 
          professional programmer. It is very possible that the advice I give in this section
          is also incorrect. Read this with that frame of refrence in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could do this program again I would do a few things. Firstly I would write it in Java. Python is an awesome language, and I learned
          a lot more about it in the making of this program, but Java has the upside of being strictly object oriented, as well as having a built in
          graphics manager. I would have made a Student class that holds all of the data for each student, and I would not have stored the data in a 
          database. A database is far more complicated than what is needed for this program, I probably would use a CSV file now. I also would have made
          a class file for the menuFrame, as it was in every single frame of the project, yet I re-wrote it every time. This was a pain.
